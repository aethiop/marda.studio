      <h2>Welcome to Marda Studios</h2>
      <p class="gap">We believe in giving users control over their platforms. We build
        decentralized
        applications that are owned and controlled by the people who use them. </p>

      <ul class="left gap">
        <li class="crack">
          The first
          and most important rule is that users must be in control. The platforms and applications we build must be
          owned
          and
          operated by the people who use them.
        </li>
        <li class="crack">
          The second rule is that all data must be open and accessible. This is vitally important for ensuring
          transparency
          and
          accountability. </li>

        <li class="crack">
          Finally, we must always remember that we are building this internet for the people, by the people. We must put
          the needs
          of the users first and always remember that technology is only a tool; it is the people who use it that make
          it great.
